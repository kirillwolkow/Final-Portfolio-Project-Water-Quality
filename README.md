# Final Portfolio Project: Water Quality

- Created an analysis on water quality and its features
- Used data from Kaggle

## Code and Resources Used
Python Version: 3.7
  Packages: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib & Seaborn
-Jupyter Notebook
https://www.codecademy.com/paths/data-analyst/tracks/dacp-data-analyst-final-portfolio-project/modules/dacp-data-analyst-final-portfolio-project/kanban_projects/data-analyst-final-portfolio
-Data is given from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/adityakadiwal/water-potability?select=water_potability.csv

## Summary/Findings
There is no linear relationship between the features that can explain the target variable(potability). So, Linear model may not work on this problem. We need to try with probability based models. Since I don't currently have the skills to work with machine learning and statistical models, I'm leaving this step out. I will work on this project in the future as soon as I have enough knowledge.

## Review
- Are there things that should be done differently?
    Hypothesis Testing with ML
- How can this be used in the future?
    You can use these stats for predictions on potability of water
- Is there more data to look at? 
    A bigger dataset could increase the significance of results
